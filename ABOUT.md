# About Sharp 4

Sharp 4 was built and is maintained by [Code16](http://code16.fr), a french web agency located in Strasbourg. More precisely, inside Code16, [Philippe Lonchampt](https://twitter.com/dvlpp) and Antoine Guingand worked hard on this.

Sharp 4 is named after... [Sharp 3](https://github.com/dvlpp/sharp), which was a far less ambitious and more personal project, which itself evolved in 3 major versions since 2014. Sharp 3 is still used in many of our client projects, handling for instance the content, the ticketing configuration and orders and some resource data for a [french music festival](http://www.festivalmusica.org/), or all this plus e-commerce logic and data for a [large stores chain](https://ambianceetstyles.com/).

The Sharp name itself is a reference to Quincy Sharp, which is the director of the Arkham Asylum in some Batman universe, just because Code16 is part of a group of talented people named [Gotham](http://www.gothamscm.com/) in honour of [our building](https://www.google.fr/maps/@48.5840255,7.7423656,3a,75y,187.52h,113.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFTtlI_qDjKuXKM9yMiV7ZQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
