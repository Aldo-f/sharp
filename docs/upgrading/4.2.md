# Upgrading from 4.1 to 4.2

This should be straightforward, the only breaking change concerns an undocumented (at the time) feature, SharpContext.

## The `WithSharpFormContext` trait

First, the `Code16\Sharp\Http\WithSharpFormContext` trait was renamed to `Code16\Sharp\Http\WithSharpContext`.

## The `entityId()` method

And second, the `entityId()` method of `SharpContext` was renamed to a much clearer `instanceId()` method.
