# Authentication

Let's start with authentication, even if this subject seems to be non Sharp related: its is, actually, and without a bit of configuration nothing will work, because Sharp can't be used as a guest.

Sharp uses the standard Laravel authentication.

## Configure user attributes

The Sharp login form asks for a login and a password field; to handle the authentication, Sharp has to know what attributes it must test in your User model. Defaults are `email` and `password`, and can be overriden in the Sharp config:


    // in config/sharp.php
    
    "auth" => [
        "login_attribute" => "login",
        "password_attribute" => "pwd",
        "display_attribute" => "name",
    ]

The third attribute, `display_attribute`, is used to display the user name in the Sharp UI. Default is `name`.


## Add a authentication check

It's very likely that you don't want to authorize all users to access Sharp. You can add a additional check based on the current user. First, write a class that implements `Code16\Sharp\Auth\SharpAuthCheck`:

    class MySharpAuthCheck implements SharpAuthCheck
    {
        public function allowUserInSharp($user): bool
        {
            return $user->hasGroup("sharp");
        }
    }

Next, add this class to the config:

    //in config/sharp.php

    "auth" => [
        "check" => MySharpAuthCheck::class,
    ]

And you are good to go!

> Note that Sharp always try to avoid any change on your functional code, to keep his full separation principle â€” this is why it is designed to handle things like this check in a separate dedicated class, and not in the User model.


## Custom guard

Finally, can hook into the the [Laravel custom guards](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/authentication#adding-custom-guards) functionality, with one config key:

    //in config/sharp.php

    "auth" => [
        "guard" => "sharp",
    ]

Of course, this implies that you defined a "sharp" guard in `config/auth.php`, as detailed in the Laravel documentation.
