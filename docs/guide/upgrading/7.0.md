# Upgrading from 6.x to 7.x

## Laravel 8+ and php 8.0+ required

It's not a BC, but still, minimal requirements are now these.

## Type hinting everywhere (part II)

In order to reinforce the API, we decided to use PHP type hinting everywhere. Sharp 6 handled the big part, but with php 8.0 we could add a few that were missing.

## EntityListQueryParams is now an instance property of an EntityList 

This means that the `getListData()` function no longer has a `$params` argument, which must be replaced by `$this->queryParams`. This change makes it much easier to build the EntityList depending on the request (hide some columns for instance). 

## DashboardQueryParams is now an instance property of a Dashboard

Similarly, the `buildWidgetsData()` function no longer has a `$params` argument, which must be replaced by `$this->queryParams`.
