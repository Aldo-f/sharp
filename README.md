Sharp is not a CMS: it's a content management framework, a toolset which provides help to build a CMS section in a website, with some rules in mind:
- the public website **should not have any knowledge of the CMS** â€” the CMS is a part of the system, not the center of it. In fact, removing the CMS should not have any effect on the project.
- The CMS **should not have any expectations from the persistence layer**: MySQL is cool, but it's not the perfect tool for every problem. And more important, the DB structure has nothing to do with the CMS.
- Content administrators **should work with their data and terminology**, not CMS terms. I mean, if the project is about spaceships, space travels and pilots, why would the CMS talk about articles, categories and tags?
- website developers **should not have to work on the front-end development** for the CMS. Yeah. Because life is complicated enough, Sharp takes care of all the responsive / CSS / JS stuff.

Sharp intends to provide a clean solution to the following needs:
- create, update or delete any structured data of the project, handling validation and errors;
- display, search, sort or filter data;
- execute custom commands on one instance, a selection or all instances;
- handle authorizations and validation;
- all without write a line of front code, and using a clean API in the PHP app.

Sharp needs Laravel 7+ and PHP 7.4.0+.
